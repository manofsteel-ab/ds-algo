"""
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point
 at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
 of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis
 forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
